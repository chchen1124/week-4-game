# week-4-game

Summary:jQuery application that generates a random number between 19 and 120 for the player. There are also four crystals in the game. Each crystal is given a random value between 1 and 12. If you click on a crystal then you increment your score by the crystal value. If the score is greater than the random value generated for you, you lose. If the score is equal to the random value then you win. After each game a new random value is generated and the score is reset to 0.
